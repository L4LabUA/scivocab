Git instructions for Jessie
===========================

Steps to add/change files.

1. Make sure you have the latest version of the code by running `git pull`
2. Add or change files (in the normal way).
3. Stage the changes by doing `git add .` (the `.` means everything in the current directory).
4. Commit the changes by doing `git commit -m "commit message"` (replace `commit message` with a one sentence description of the changes you are making)
5. Push the changes to the remote Github.com server by doing `git push`
